As a part of this assignment, you will perform image classification using CNNs in PyTorch. The dataset which you'll be using in this assignment will be the standard CIFAR-10 dataset. One important thing you need to know about CIFAR-10 dataset is that the image dimensions in this dataset is 32 $\\times$ 32, which is not as same as the MNIST dataset dimension which you might've used while learning FNNs. This notebook contains some pre-written code blocks and some empty cells which you need to fill to build a CNN and perform Image Classification. <br>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HNlYdIZkoxff"},"source":["### Importing Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"eVZhz75Voxfg"},"outputs":[],"source":["# PyTorch Library\n","import torch\n","# PyTorch Neural Network\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","# Allows us to transform data\n","import torchvision.transforms as transforms\n","# Allows us to download the dataset\n","import torchvision.datasets as dsets\n","# Used to graph data and loss curves\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","# Allows us to use arrays to manipulate and store data\n","import numpy as np\n","import random\n","import seaborn"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"8YN3thLhoxfh"},"outputs":[],"source":["def set_seed(seed=42):\n","    '''Sets the seed of the entire notebook so results are the same every time we run.\n","    This is for REPRODUCIBILITY.'''\n","    np.random.seed(seed)\n","    torch.manual_seed(seed)\n","    torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)\n","\n","set_seed(42)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"INkFQp-moxfi"},"source":["### Load Dataset\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"v_V_kojToxfi","outputId":"7b74078d-140b-43d9-8ff4-9630ebc8e4cc"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Downloading https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz to ./data\\cifar-10-python.tar.gz\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["100.0%\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Extracting ./data\\cifar-10-python.tar.gz to ./data\n","Files already downloaded and verified\n"]}],"source":["### DO NOT CHANGE THIS CODE\n","\n","composed = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5,0.5,0.5),(0.5,0.5,0.5))])\n","train = dsets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=composed)\n","test = dsets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=composed)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"4fvRisMioxfk"},"outputs":[],"source":["from torch.utils.data import random_split, DataLoader\n","\n","train_ds, val_ds = random_split(train, [45000,5000])\n","train_loader = DataLoader(train_ds, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)\n","val_loader = DataLoader(val_ds, batch_size=64)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"C_b9XLSEoxfl"},"source":["### Training/Testing Split"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BHrNj4_Coxfl"},"source":["Load Dataset<br>\n","Split the dataset into x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Gm9eRqLjoxfm"},"outputs":[],"source":["## :)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Zhi7VjjUoxfm"},"source":["### Display Images and Label"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wJOKRNDmoxfm"},"source":["Choose 16 images randomly and display them aling with their labels in a 4x4 grid\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"3voS7ycwoxfm"},"outputs":[],"source":["## :)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bM1JBlLGoxfn"},"source":["### Modelling\n","\n","Define a class which will form the architecture of your CNN model\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"BzLjsG_7oxfn"},"outputs":[],"source":["class CNN(nn.Module):\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        pass\n","        '''Under this function define the convolutional, pooling,\n","           fully connected layers.
