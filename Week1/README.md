# Week1

Task 1:
Used the Supper Vector Machines Classifier, the accuracy was found out to be maximum from the training size of 0.8 onwards. 

Task 2:
Here are the accuracy scores
DecisionTree: 0.8324
KNN: 0.8156
Naive Bayes: 0.771
RandomForest: 0.8436
GradientBoost: 0.8436
AdaBoost: 0.821

Thus the best classifiers are from the ensemble methods namely RandomForest and GradientBoost
